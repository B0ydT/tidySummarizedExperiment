\title{Group by one or more variables}
\usage{
\method{filter}{SummarizedExperiment}(.data, ..., .preserve = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A tidySummarizedExperiment object or any data frame}

\item{...}{In \code{group_by()}, variables or computations to group by.
In \code{ungroup()}, variables to remove from the grouping.}

\item{.preserve}{when \code{FALSE} (the default), the grouping structure
is recalculated based on the resulting data, otherwise it is kept as is.}

\item{.add}{When \code{FALSE}, the default, \code{group_by()} will
override existing groups. To add to the existing groups, use
\code{.add=TRUE}.

This argument was previously called \code{add}, but that prevented
creating a new grouping variable called \code{add}, and conflicts with
our naming conventions.}
}
\description{
Most data operations are done on groups defined by variables.
\code{group_by()} takes an existing tbl and converts it into a grouped tbl
where operations are performed "by group". \code{ungroup()} removes grouping.
